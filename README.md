Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization library for ROS - Version 2
=============================================================

AMCL is a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in
2D. It implements the adaptive (or KLD-sampling) Monte Carlo
localization approach (as described by Dieter Fox), which uses a
particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known map.
It is derived, with thanks, from Andrew Howard's excellent
'amcl' Player driver.

The original ROS wrapper for amcl can be found in the navigation stack:
